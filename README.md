# CSI-240: Intro To Programming - Final Project

For the final project of _Intro to Programming_ me and two other classmates created a logic gate simulator. This was the first real team project that I, the owner of the repo, worked on. The people who helped create this project are listed under collaborators. The teacher of the class was Wei Kain Chen; who is also listed under the collaborators.
